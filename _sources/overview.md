# Overview
In this workshop we will do a **few** things:
1. Introduce you to colonial statistical datasets
2. Introduce you to (re)constructing historical datasets
3. Use Kepler.GL to map our datasets 

`````{admonition} For your reference!
:class: tip
There are advantages and disadvantages to all kinds of mapping software. Kepler GL is not perfect but it is open-source (so you won't lose your data behind a pay-wall) and it provides many data visualisation and anlysis functionalities that requires no coding experience.
`````
### Why are we Using Kepler GL?

### What do we Need?
- A Dropbox account (to save and share our maps)

`````{admonition} What we can't do today!
:class: tip
Because Kepler is a client-side web application you cannot save or generate hyper-links to your maps directly from their website. We will be downloading the raw code of our maps so that we can share them with others (today we'll do this through Dropbox) and so we can re-upload them to the Kepler site to make additional changes.
